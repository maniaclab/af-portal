# Submitting to the Analysis Facility

The UChicago Analysis Facility uses HTCondor for batch workloads. You will need to define an executable script and a "submit" file that describes your job. A simple job that loads the ATLAS environment looks something like this:

Job script, called myjob.sh:

    #!/bin/bash
    export ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE=/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase
    export ALRB_localConfigDir=$HOME/localConfig
    source ${ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE}/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh
    # at this point, you can lsetup root, rucio, athena, etc..

Submit file, called myjob.sub:

    Universe = vanilla

    Output = myjob.$(Cluster).$(Process).out
    Error = myjob.$(Cluster).$(Process).err
    Log = myjob.log

    Executable = myjob.sh

    request_memory = 1GB
    request_cpus = 1

    Queue 1

By default, your jobs will be submitted via the long queue, with no time limits. However, in order to make your jobs start faster, you can request specifically to send them via the short queue. This is for jobs that should take under 4 hours. For this purpose, you need to add a line in your submit file:

    +queue="short"

The condor_submit command is used to queue jobs:

    $ condor_submit myjob.sub
    Submitting job(s).
    1 job(s) submitted to cluster 17.

And the condor_q command is used to view the queue:

    [lincolnb@login01 ~]$ condor_q
    -- Schedd: head01.af.uchicago.edu : &lt;192.170.240.14:9618?... @ 07/22/21 11:28:26
    OWNER    BATCH_NAME    SUBMITTED   DONE   RUN    IDLE  TOTAL JOB_IDS
    lincolnb ID: 17       7/22 11:27      _      1      _      1 17.0

    Total for query: 1 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 0 idle, 1 running, 0 held, 0 suspended
    Total for lincolnb: 1 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 0 idle, 1 running, 0 held, 0 suspended
    Total for all users: 1 jobs; 0 completed, 0 removed, 0 idle, 1 running, 0 held, 0 suspended

## Configuring your jobs to use an X509 Proxy Certificate

If you need to use an X509 Proxy, e.g. to access ATLAS Data, you will want to copy your X509 certificate to the Analysis Facility.

Store your certificate in <code>$HOME/.globus</code> and create a ATLAS VOMS proxy in the usual way:

    export ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE=/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase
    export ALRB_localConfigDir=$HOME/localConfig
    source ${ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE}/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh
    lsetup emi
    voms-proxy-init -voms atlas -out $HOME/x509proxy

You will want to generate the proxy on, or copy it to, the shared $HOME filesystem so that the HTCondor scheduler can find and read the proxy. With the following additions to your jobscript, HTCondor will configure the job enviroment automatically for X509 authenticated data access:

    use_x509userproxy = true
    x509userproxy = /home/YOURUSERNAME/x509proxy

E.g., in the job above for the user lincolnb:

    Universe = vanilla

    Output = myjob.$(Cluster).$(Process).out
    Error = myjob.$(Cluster).$(Process).err
    Log = myjob.log

    Executable = myjob.sh

    use_x509userproxy = true
    x509userproxy = /home/lincolnb/x509proxy

    request_memory = 1GB
    request_cpus = 1

    Queue 1

## Limits

Currently there is a limit to max of 64GB RAM and max 16 cores/CPUs that you can request per job.

## Using Analysis Facility Filesystems

When submitting jobs, you should try to use the local scratch filesystem whenever possible. This will help you be a "good neighbor" to other users on the system, and reduce overall stress on the shared filesystems, which can lead to slowness, downtimes, etc. By default, jobs start in the $SCRATCH directory on the worker nodes. Output data will need to be staged to the shared filesystem or it will be lost!

In the following example, data is read from Rucio, we pretend to process it, and then push a small output copied back to the $HOME filesystem. It assumes your X509 proxy certificate is valid and in your home directory.

    #!/bin/bash
    export ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE=/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase
    export ALRB_localConfigDir=$HOME/localConfig
    source ${ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE}/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh
    lsetup rucio
    rucio --verbose download --rse MWT2_DATADISK data16_13TeV:AOD.11071822._001488.pool.root.1

    # You can run things like asetup as well
    asetup AnalysisBase,21.2.81

    # This is where you would do your data analysis via AnalysisBase, etc. We will
    # just pretend to do that, and truncate the file to simulate generating an
    # output file. This is definitely not what you want to do in a real analysis!
    cd data16_13TeV
    truncate --size 10MB AOD.11071822._001488.pool.root.1
    cp AOD.11071822._001488.pool.root.1 $HOME/myjob.output

It gets submitted in the usual way:

    Universe = vanilla

    Output = myjob.$(Cluster).$(Process).out
    Error = myjob.$(Cluster).$(Process).err
    Log = myjob.log

    Executable = myjob.sh

    use_x509userproxy = true
    x509userproxy = /home/lincolnb/x509proxy

    request_memory = 1GB
    request_cpus = 1

    Queue 1

And then:

    $ condor_submit myjob.sub
    Submitting job(s).
    1 job(s) submitted to cluster 17.

## Using Docker / Singularity containers (Advanced)

Some users may want to bring their own container-based workloads to the Analysis Facility. We support both Docker-based jobs as well as Singularity-based jobs. Additionally, the CVMFS repository unpacked.cern.ch is mounted on all nodes.

If, for whatever reason, you wanted to run a Debian Linux-based container on the Analysis Facilty, it would be as simple as the following Job file:

    universe                = docker
    docker_image            = debian
    executable              = /bin/cat
    arguments               = /etc/hosts
    should_transfer_files   = YES
    when_to_transfer_output = ON_EXIT
    output                  = out.$(Process)
    error                   = err.$(Process)
    log                     = log.$(Process)
    request_memory          = 1000M
    queue 1

Similarly, if you would like to run a Singularity container, such as the ones provided in th unpacked.cern.ch CVMFS repo, you can submit a normal vanilla universe job, with a job executable that looks something like the following:

    #!/bin/bash
    singularity run -B /cvmfs -B /home /cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/registry.hub.docker.com/atlas/rucio-clients:default rucio --version

Replacing the `rucio-clients:default` container and `rucio --version` executable with your preferred software.
